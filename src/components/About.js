        <p className="card-text">The organization was started in December 2022 by members of a youth social WhatsApp group, 
        MAARA FREEDOM CORNER. (M.F.C).
      A faction of the groups administrators team realized the marginalization of some needy bright students in their community 
      and with that the inception of an idea to start a scholarship program in Maara Constituency. The idea was for every member 
      in M.F.C to voluntary contribute a minimum of ksh100 (USD 0.80) each month to be able to fund our program.
      The idea was highly bought by a majority of our most active members in the group. A consensus was reached and members
      decided to sponsor atleast 20 students to high school education . 
      The motto for Watoto Wasome initiative  “ A helping hand to a hoping heart” ,  tells you to join this organization and 
      sacrifice as low as 0.8 dollars monthly and change a life.</p>
